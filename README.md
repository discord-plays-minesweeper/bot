Yes, you are allowed to host it yourself, or make spin-offs of it. Just don't copy it, claim it as yours, sell it, etc. **(THIS IS __NOT__ LEGAL INFO)**
If you make a spin-off then you are required to state in the credits that it is a spin-off and provide a link to the original version without suggesting that we (the developers of Discord Plays Minesweeper) had any role in developing your forked version.
